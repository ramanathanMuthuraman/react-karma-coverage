# react-karma-coverage
A sample react js project with code coverage implementation 

## Description
Javascript unit testing is an integral part of any web application development. With Javascript's Sonic Boom we have lots of options to choose from. In this repo we will be creting test suites for a sample react js project with the code-coverage measurement.

Using this as the [sample project] (https://github.com/ramanathanMuthuraman/React-Duck2Go), we use mocha test suites together with karma and istanbul to get our coverage results.

### Demo

You an check the coverage results [here] (https://react-karma-coverage-myjournal-1.c9.io/PhantomJS%201.9.8%20(Linux%200.0.0)/index.html)
