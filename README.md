# react-karma-coverage
Javascript unit testing is an integral part of any web application, but how do you know that you've tested the code that matters? Did you cover the most important components? Did you test the sad path? The edge cases? 

Istanbul is here to do the job. In this repo we will be creating test suites and its coverage report for a sample React JS project. Below is the technology stack used.

* [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
* [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html)
* [Istanbul](https://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/)
* [Browser-sync](http://www.browsersync.io/)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

## Installation

Downlaod the repo and navigate to the root folder and install the dependencies

```
npm install

```
