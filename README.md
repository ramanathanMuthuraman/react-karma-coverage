# react-karma-coverage
A sample React JS project with code coverage implementation 

## Description
Javascript unit testing is an integral part of any web application development. With Javascript's Sonic Boom we have lots of options(frameworks/libraries) to choose from. In this repo we will be creting test suites for a sample React JS project with the code-coverage measurement.

Using this as the [sample project] (https://github.com/ramanathanMuthuraman/React-Duck2Go), we use [mocha] (https://mochajs.org/) test suites together with [karma] (http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html) and [istanbul] (https://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/) to get our coverage results.

### Demo

You can check the coverage results [here] (https://react-karma-coverage-myjournal-1.c9.io/PhantomJS%201.9.8%20(Linux%200.0.0)/index.html)
